# Hello World

Welcome to my notes! This is a sample post written in markdown.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is perfect for note-taking because:

1. It's simple to learn
2. It's easy to read in its raw form
3. It converts beautifully to HTML
4. It works great with version control

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Next Steps

Feel free to:
- Create new posts in the `posts/` directory
- Edit existing posts
- Use any markdown editor you prefer
- Push changes to GitHub

Remember: The simpler the solution, the more maintainable it becomes.
