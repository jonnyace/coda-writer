# Welcome to My Blog

This is our first published post. It demonstrates the new blog structure with separate directories for:

- Drafts
- Published posts
- Generated HTML

## How It Works

1. Write posts in markdown
2. Keep drafts in the `drafts/` directory
3. Move to `posts/` when ready to publish
4. Generated HTML goes to `html/` directory

## Next Steps

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
